title: Hydropower plants
seoDescription: >-
  Large systems, such as large manufacturing or power plants, telecommunication
  or computer networks, require distributed control, monitoring and diagnosis. A
  combination with AI and cameras, intelligent agents are software modules able
  to make decisions on their own, communicate with each other, learn new things
  and even “travel” from system to system.

      ## Smart cameras & edge computing


      The surveillance system can be superimposed with smart cameras and edge
      computing over the existing SCADA control and monitoring network. This
      aims to increase performance, efficiency and stability in the existing
      monitoring system. Better detection of corrosion, intruders, water
      reservoir and flow, dam movement monitoring, concrete monitoring, climate
      monitoring, lake filling and water distribution.
