    An attractive partner model is when a partner improves our team, in pursuit
    of a common goal. We are willing to invest time and resources to develop
    such a partnership. A desirable relationship could be mutually dependent and
    beneficial to us, to our partners and our customers.

    ## Our system is open to third parties

    The BlueThink™ platform delivers any data or video required for software
    applications to perform their functions, while allowing the results from
    those applications to be presented back into the platform for use by other
    applications. With this, SEALAB is in a unique position to store and analyze
    data produced even by third-parties.

    ## Artificial intelligence systems

    For third parties, BlueThink™ removes the complexity of integrating with
    other systems by providing a single, uniform, and robust communication
    interface. SEALAB is currently working on several BlueThink™-enabled
    applications and AIs, including:

        ### 3D biomass estimation + MonitorFish


        SEALAB and MonitorFish have entered into an exciting collaboration on
        biomass estimation. 


        MonitorFish is a multicultural team of innovation-driven experts
        offering cognitive capabilities of Artificial Intelligence in fish
        farming. They provide fish farmers with a precise action plan in
        real-time to maintain the highest quantity and quality of the fish.

        ### Image enhancer + Intel


        SEALAB and Intel are collaborating on image enhancement using FPGA. 


        FPGA is an acronym for Field Programmable Gate Array—a
        semiconductor-integrated circuit where a large majority of the
        electrical functionality inside the device can be changed, even after
        the equipment has been shipped to customers out in the ‘field’. These
        powerful devices can be customized to accelerate key workloads and
        enable design engineers to adapt to emerging standards or changing
        requirements.
