    An attractive
    partner model is when a partner improves our team, in pursuit of a common
    goal. We are willing to invest time and resources to develop such a
    partnership. A desirable relationship could be mutually dependent and
    beneficial to us, to our partners and our customers.

    ## Our system is open to third parties

    The BlueThink™ platform delivers any data or video required for software applications to perform their functions, while allowing the results from those applications to be presented back into the platform for use by other applications. With this, SEALAB is in a unique position to store and analyze data produced even by third-parties.

        ### Image Enhancer + Intel

        SEALAB and Intel are collaborating on image enhancement using FPGA.

        FPGA is an acronym for field programmable gate array—a semiconductor-integrated circuit where a large majority of the electrical functionality inside the device can be changed, even after the equipment has been shipped to customers out in the ‘field’. These powerful devices can be customized to accelerate key workloads and enable design engineers to adapt to emerging standards or changing requirements.
