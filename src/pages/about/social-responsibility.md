          Safeguarding the ocean space is integral to our vision of giving everyone
          the opportunity to see under water. SEALAB is therefore dedicated to
          contributing to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. 
          

          In addition to the specific goal of sustainable management of sea life (SDG 14), activities related to the sea make important contributions to other areas, such as; food production (SDG 2), responsible consumption and production (SDG 12),
          employment and economic growth (SDG 8), innovation and infrastructure (SDG
          9) and climate action (SDG 13).

          ## The three pillars of sustainability

          The ocean space is a key resource for energy, food, minerals, leisure, and transportation. It represents huge potential for value creation. Yet data and knowledge about the ocean space is scarce, and concerns are rising over its health and sustainability. 
          
          
          SEALAB is therefor running a healthy business with a strong focus on the environment, economy and the responsibility for our employees and society.
