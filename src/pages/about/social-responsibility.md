    Safeguarding the ocean space is integral to our vision of giving everyone
    the opportunity to see under water. SEALAB is therefore dedicated to
    contributing to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. 


    In addition to the specific goal of sustainable management of sea life (SDG
    14), activities related to the sea make important contributions to other
    areas, such as; food production (SDG 2), responsible consumption and
    production (SDG 12), employment and economic growth (SDG 8), innovation and
    infrastructure (SDG 9) and climate action (SDG 13).

    ## The three pillars of sustainability

    The ocean space is a key resource for energy, food, minerals, leisure, and
    transportation. It represents huge potential for value creation. Yet data
    and knowledge about the ocean space is scarce, and concerns are rising over
    its health and sustainability. 


    SEALAB is therefor running a healthy business with a strong focus on the
    environment, economy and the responsibility for our employees and society.
