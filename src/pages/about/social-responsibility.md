    The ocean space is a key resource for energy, food, minerals, leisure, and
    transportation. It represents huge potential for value creation. Yet data
    and knowledge about the ocean space is scarce, and concerns are rising over
    its’ health and sustainability. SEALAB solutions are not just investments in
    growth and economic sustainability, they provide a leap in data acquisition
    and knowledge creation about human impact on the world’s largest ecosystems.


    In addition to the specific goal of sustainable management of sea life (SDG
    14), activities related to the sea make important contributions to other
    goals, such as; food security (SDG 2), responsible consumption and
    production (SDG 12), employment and economic growth (SDG 8), innovation and
    infrastructure (SDG 9) and climate action (SDG 13).
