SEALAB aims to achieve an average of 12% annual revenue growth over the next decade. Around a third of this will be organic growth, while two-thirds will be acquired growth. Through this growth, we will be able to enhance our product offering, gain additional industry knowledge and insight, and enter even more markets around the world.

The market for software, AI, analytics systems and equipment for the Ocean Space is expected to grow a lot in the long term. Driven by our extensive innovation investment and market penetration, we aim to grow organically faster than the market.

We will supplement our full line offering and accelerate market penetration through acquisitions. Our solid operational performance and expected cash flow can support 5-7% revenue growth on average through acquisitions. Growth will not be linear but will reflect opportunities and economic fluctuations.
