        #### Development of smart algorithms

        We know our rivals, down to each tattoo and have done the right prep
        work to take down any opponent until we hit the exit. Beta testing and
        close collaboration with our customers. Additionally, we gather data to
        continue the development of smart algorithms and software packages.
