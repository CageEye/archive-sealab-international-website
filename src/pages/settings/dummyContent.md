    IoT, The Internet of Things is now a reality in the ocean space industries
    due to the convergence of technologies such as wireless communications,
    micro-electrical systems and of course, the Internet.


    A “thing” is any object with embedded electronics that can transfer data
    over a network, without any human interaction. This could be underwater
    cameras, environmental sensors, devices in a control room, or components in
    a vessel.
