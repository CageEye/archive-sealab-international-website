shortDescription: >-
  The new SEALAB-camera is completely groundbreaking in marine environments and
  uses up to six lenses. The optics are optimized for use in several tasks in
  the Ocean Space. SEALAB's basic camera DNA is of course essential. The data
  platform has several separate lenses that are combined and used together.
  Thus, you get both 2D and 3D images using advanced software and Artificial
  Intelligence that gives you pictures in unparalleled detail, regardless of
  lighting conditions - regardless of depth.

  This, in combination with the image sensors being SEALAB's largest ever, makes it possible to get exceptionally good night pictures below the surface. Clear and colorful images that far exceed what you can see with the naked eye. And best of all, Intel inside.
