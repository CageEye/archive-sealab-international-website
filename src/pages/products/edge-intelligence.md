    ## The role of Edge in 5G


    By 2023, 5G will make up around one-fifth of all mobile data traffic, where
    25% of the use-cases will depend on edge computing capabilities. The
    majority of the new 5G revenue potential is expected to come from enterprise
    & IoT services, of which many will rely on edge computing.  Therefore edge
    capabilities will be a fundamental technology as part of a 5G infrastructure
    for any service provider.

## What is Edge Computing?

Edge computing in telecom, provides execution resources (compute and storage) for applications with networking close to the end users, typically within or at the boundary of operator networks. 

Edge computing can also be placed at enterprise premises, for example inside factory buildings, in homes and vehicles, including trains, planes and private cars. The edge infrastructure can be managed or hosted by communication service providers or other types of service providers.
