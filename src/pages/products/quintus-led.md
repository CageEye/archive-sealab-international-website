    description: >-
      The 5 separate LED lights can be controlled and dimmed between 0-100%. To
      avoid stressing the fish, the light is slowly dimmed towards full
      strength. The design and positioning relative to the camera facilitate the
      desired light level of the target object in addition to low
      backscattering.
