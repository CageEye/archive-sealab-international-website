heading: Edge computing
subheading: Yes, it's more than meets the eye.
seoDescription: >-
  Edge computing is about processing at the points in the value chain where it is useful and efficient. Machine vision and artificial intelligence require a data volume, data quality, and frequency that challenge earlier paradigms such as Cloud computing. Instead of transporting all data to the cloud, important processing is done at the edge.

  heading: System on Chip Developed by SEALAB
  subheading: Based on Experience from the Whole Value Chain
  content: We provide solutions for the whole value chain; from physical devices like our great camera to software applications like BlueThink™ GO. Edge computing is the part where all the magic happens. Data is collected locally and processed at the edge.

      subheading: System on Chip
      heading: 'Central to this is the most valuable component in any imaging infrastructure: the camera.'
      content: We are developing System on Chips with FPGA technology inside that fulfil the most demanding computer vision and AI tasks. The on-chip processing gets past challenges around massive data generation and poor image quality by doing the processing in the camera unit itself. Our System on Chip can be customised for different cameras and tasks.

  heading: How the aquaculture industry can benefit from Edge Computing
  content: Smart FPGA technology in combination with software lifts data transfer and remote operations to a new level. The possibilities are already starting right behind the image sensor. Images and video are distributed with the correct resolution, bit depth, bit rate and frame rate needed.

    - heading: Edge Computing will power the aquaculture industry
      subheading: Biomass estimation
      content: If the algorithm and AI solution you implemented for biomass estimation need two stills per second, it is unnecessary to overload the network with two 4k video streams with many frames per second. By using FPGA technology you can enhance the image quality while reducing the amount of data. This will be a huge step in terms of smart and efficient data transmission.

    ## The role of Edge in 5G


    By 2023, 5G will make up around one-fifth of all mobile data traffic, where 25% of the use-cases will depend on edge computing capabilities. The majority of the new 5G revenue potential is expected to come from enterprise & IoT services, of which many will rely on edge computing. Therefore edge capabilities will be a fundamental technology as part of a 5G infrastructure for any service provider.
    
    SEALABs approach to EDGE computing is both market-driven and based on cutting edge research. Our participation in leading research consortiums on machine vision, AI and 5G technology has put us ahead of the curve, able to develop products with future proof capabilities.
