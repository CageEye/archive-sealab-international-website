    IoT, The Internet of Things is now a reality in the ocean space industries
    due to the convergence of technologies such as wireless communications,
    micro-electrical systems and of course, the Internet.


    A “thing” is any object with embedded electronics that can transfer data
    over a network, without any human interaction. This could be underwater
    cameras, environmental sensors, devices in a control room, or components in
    a vessel.

  ### BlueThink™

  ## Software platform for IoT integration, video distribution, and data
  handling

  SEALAB has developed a software platform that supports IoT. The BlueThink™
  platform delivers any data or video required for software applications to
  perform their functions, while allowing the results from those applications to
  be presented back into the platform for use by other applications.

    The Internet of Things is about all the things around us being connected to
    the internet. When things are connected to the network, they can connect,
    talk to each other and to the surroundings. This allows us to remotely
    control the devices and collect data in a way that was previously
    impossible.


    SEALAB delivers complete IoT-systems to the aquaculture industry. All
    components installed in the cages and on the feed barge are connected
    through the Internet of Things; Underwater Cameras, Underwater lights,
    environmental sensors, Winches, Service Tablets, Control Rooms and more.

      ## We contribute to better infrastructure with 5G

      The new 5G network is on everyone’s minds these days, and for good reason.
      Not only will 5G improve how we use and communicate with technology, it
      will also change how various technologies communicate with one another.


      Read more about how SEALAB contributes to develop new 5G solutions through
      5G-HEART, a project founded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research
      and innovation programme.

    The digitalization of the ocean space has come so far that the living
    conditions for digital twins are present in several industries.

    BlueThink is designed to support this technology. This said based on the
    amount of data the platform is able to collect using from sensors (IoT),
    it’s ability to process large amounts of data (AI) and extract lessons from
    these huge amounts of data (Machine Learning).
