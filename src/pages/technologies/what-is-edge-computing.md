## What is edge computing?

Edge computing in telecom, provides execution resources (compute and storage) for applications with networking close to the end users, typically within or at the boundary of operator networks. 

Edge computing can also be placed at enterprise premises, for example inside factory buildings, in homes and vehicles, including trains, planes and private cars. The edge infrastructure can be managed or hosted by communication service providers or other types of service providers.
