      Environmental education is one of the essential pillars to amaze, raise
      awareness and inculcate new behaviors in children, the citizens of
      tomorrow. SEALAB brings the Ocean in the School by broadcasting live from
      the deep and into the classroom. This technology also acts as a tool to
      support children in retaining and retrieving knowledge for life-long
      learning.


      Teachers easily get a toolkit needed to engage children to engage in
      future solutions that must be developed to safeguard the ocean and the
      global environment.

      ## Give everyone the opportunity to see under water




      SEALAB gives everyone the opportunity to see underwater, not least to the
      growing family that is more than ever concerned with the environment and
      knowledge of the sea.




      Aquariums all over the world will be able to stream in broadcast quality
      and out on the internet. Machine vision and AI will be able to tell in
      real time what fish you see, how the fish are doing and thus build
      knowledge for the recipient.
