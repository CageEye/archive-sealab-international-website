      A wellboat carries live fish and has a great need for fish welfare to be
      observed. Better survivability equals better earnings and a better
      reputation in the market. SEALAB is a true wellboat innovator and has come
      up with a unique software that was originally developed for use in salmon
      cages. With machine vision that continuously measures the Respiratory Rate
      in the fish, you get a real-time reporting system on board and which
      constantly shows the stress factor in the fish. Here is an example of how
      the software works:


      For transferring the fishes from the cages into the boat, huge pipelines
      are connected to the fishes’ breeding enclosures in the high seas.


      These pipes transfer the fishes into the boat’s container area without
      disturbing the fishes in any manner whatsoever. SEALAB's sensor system
      monitors the fish in the well or tank for the storage and transport of
      live fish for the delivery to port and final processing on land.
