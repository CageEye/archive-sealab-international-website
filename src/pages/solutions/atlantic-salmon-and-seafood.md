      Aquaculture in Norway is already being improved by SEALAB's solutions
      through sharp images which in turn provides a better basis for the
      customer. And now comes many new innovations thanks to our unique edge
      computing technology combined with smart 2D and 3D sea cameras: measure
      stress levels, better the lining regime and monitoring the entire state of
      the cage. All of this helps to reduce losses and can provide a better
      survival rate. The economic benefits are increased while the environmental
      impacts are reduced.
    heading: How is SEALAB innovating the aquaculture industry?

      There are currently 430 million live salmon in Norwegian cages. Machine
      vision and AI will have tremendous positive significance and be able to
      monitor every single fish in real time.


      We’re talking about Blue Economy and Visual Analytics for the aquaculture
      industry. SEALAB also scales up globally within the same business area.
      Norway has a hard and challenging coastline. If the technology works here,
      it also works globally. Together with Norway's largest telecommunications
      operator, Telenor, we are changing everything in a disruptive way how data
      traffic, images and video are transmitted, using both 4G, 5G, radio links
      and fiber. Advanced FPGA technology and edge computing now offer
      completely new opportunities in the ocean.

    All over the world, seafood is produced. From Atlantic salmon to whitefish,
    clams, shellfish production, shrimp farming and catching and cultivation of
    seaweed and kelp. The same technology that SEALAB supplies to the Norwegian
    aquaculture industry will be able to be used worldwide with simple
    adaptations.
