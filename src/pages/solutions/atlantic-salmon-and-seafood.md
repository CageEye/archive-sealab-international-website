  There’s a growing market for food production in the sea. Norwegian salmon
  production accounts for 3% of the global seafood production.

      Atlantic salmon (Salmo Salar) and Norwegian fish farming are now Norway's
      next largest industry, beaten only by the oil and gas industry.
      Aquaculture is also growing internationally, but the Norwegian government
      has put the brakes on demand that the industry must develop better
      technology and new solutions to improve fish welfare, prevent escapes and
      at the same time reduce the environmental impact.


      Aquaculture in Norway is already being improved by SEALAB's solutions
      through sharp images which in turn provides a better basis for the
      customer. And now comes many new innovations thanks to our unique edge
      computing technology combined with smart 2D and 3D sea cameras: measuring
      stress in fish, better lining regime, monitoring the entire state of the
      cage. All of this helps to reduce losses and can provide a better survival
      rate. The economic benefits are increased at the farms while managing to
      reduce the environmental damage caused by salmon feeding.

      ## Fish Industry and Processing

      SEALABs machine vision and camera technology will increase automation and
      food safety. We have the products to help your business thrive. Optimizing
      the industry require a slaughter process that ensures that the salmon is
      safe to eat, without causing the fish unnecessary stress and pain.


      While the salmon is waiting to be slaughtered, it is placed in a holding
      pen. It’s then important to avoid unnecessary suffering and stress that
      can affect the quality of the finished product. The fish is monitored by
      smart algorithms and SEALAB Respiratory Rate system in realtime and works
      both on land or on a boat.

      Looking at the figures, there are at present 430 million live salmon in
      Norwegian cages. Machine vision and AI will have tremendous positive
      significance and be able to monitor every single fish in real time.


      We’re talking about Blue Economy and Visual Analytics for the aquaculture
      industry. SEALAB also scales up globally within the same business area.
      Norway has a hard and challenging coastline. If the technology works here,
      it also works globally. Together with Norway's largest telecommunications
      operator, Telenor, we are changing everything in a disruptive way how data
      traffic, images and video are transmitted, using both 4G, 5G, radio links
      and fiber. Advanced FPGA technology and edge computing now offer
      completely new opportunities in the ocean. 


      ***We give everyone the opportunity to see under water.***

    All over the world, seafood is produced. From Atlantic salmon to whitefish,
    clams, shellfish production, shrimp farming and catching and cultivation of
    seaweed and kelp. The same technology that SEALAB supplies to the Norwegian
    aquaculture industry will be able to be used worldwide with simple
    adaptations.

    ### For a sustainable future


    Globally land-based aquaculture facilities are increasingly being considered
    as a more sustainable alternative to open-water fish farms. Until just a few
    years ago, land-based fish farming was considered too costly, but this is
    changing as systems and technologies become increasingly sophisticated.
    Cutting edge technologies will be needed.  


    Optimizing water temperature and good access to groundwater is important,
    but sometimes expensive hydroelectric power rise the risk of the business.
    This is where better sensorics and machine vision from SEALAB come into play

    ### Setting a new standard


    Companies who seek new ways to make its facility as energy efficient and
    sustainable as possible will need real time surveillance systems for
    monitoring fish welfare and the production. SEALABs machine vision systems
    for biomass control, respiratory rate measuring, feeding control will help
    our customers to reach their goals.  


    Innovation drives the value we create. Whether hardware, software, processes
    or services, we’re dedicated to surpassing industry standards to ensure
    processors can provide food that is high quality, sustainable, and
    affordable. Our commitment to progress is highlighted by the fact that every
    year, we invest significantly more into research and development than the
    industry average.
