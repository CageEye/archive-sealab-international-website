  There’s a growing market for food production in the sea. Norwegian salmon
  production accounts for 3% of the global seafood production.

      Atlantic salmon (Salmo Salar) and Norwegian fish farming are now Norway's
      next largest industry, beaten only by the oil and gas industry.
      Aquaculture is also growing internationally, but the Norwegian government
      has put the brakes on demand that the industry must develop better
      technology and new solutions to improve fish welfare, prevent escapes and
      at the same time reduce the environmental impact.


      Aquaculture in Norway is already being improved by SEALAB's solutions
      through sharp images which in turn provides a better basis for the
      customer. And now comes many new innovations thanks to our unique edge
      computing technology combined with smart 2D and 3D sea cameras: measuring
      stress in fish, better lining regime, monitoring the entire state of the
      cage. All of this helps to reduce losses and can provide a better survival
      rate. The economic benefits are increased at the farms while managing to
      reduce the environmental damage caused by salmon feeding.

      ## Fish Industry and Processing

      SEALABs machine vision and camera technology will increase automation and
      food safety. We have the products to help your business thrive. Optimizing
      the industry require a slaughter process that ensures that the salmon is
      safe to eat, without causing the fish unnecessary stress and pain.


      While the salmon is waiting to be slaughtered, it is placed in a holding
      pen. It’s then important to avoid unnecessary suffering and stress that
      can affect the quality of the finished product. The fish is monitored by
      smart algorithms and SEALAB Respiratory Rate system in realtime and works
      both on land or on a boat.

      Looking at the figures, there are at present 430 million live salmon in
      Norwegian cages. Machine vision and AI will have tremendous positive
      significance and be able to monitor every single fish in real time.


      We’re talking about Blue Economy and Visual Analytics for the aquaculture
      industry. SEALAB also scales up globally within the same business area.
      Norway has a hard and challenging coastline. If the technology works here,
      it also works globally. Together with Norway's largest telecommunications
      operator, Telenor, we are changing everything in a disruptive way how data
      traffic, images and video are transmitted, using both 4G, 5G, radio links
      and fiber. Advanced FPGA technology and edge computing now offer
      completely new opportunities in the ocean. 


      ***We give everyone the opportunity to see under water.***

## Autonomous Vehicles

Autonomous vehicles are trained with numerous mounted cameras all around them at various heights and angles that allow it to detect how the car is moving from every perspective. The software is trained on thousands of hours of human driving footage showing the proper and safe way a vehicle should operate from various angles, in various lighting conditions, and in different weather conditions. The vessel or the underwater drone could then get a command to move to a new location. 

Navies Needs Offensive Undersea Drones, but the maritime domain has yet to see the kind of explosive innovation that UAVs have brought to land warfare. SEALABs superfast FPGA technology and smart 2D and 3D cameras will change everything in the ocean space.
