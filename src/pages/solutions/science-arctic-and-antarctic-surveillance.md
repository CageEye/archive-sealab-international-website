      Underwater drones equipped with high-tech sensors and edge computing in
      participation with smart cameras could one day patrol the icy waters of
      both Arctic and Antarctic, to help keep an eye on the region’s growing
      shipping traffic—and to be on the lookout for foreign submarines. And on
      top of that: environmental monitoring.

      ## Using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles as Sensor Platforms for
      Ice-Monitoring


      Due to the presence of drifting sea-ice and icebergs, ice management (IM)
      becomes an important part both in Arctic and Antarctic. An important part
      of an IM system is the ability to reliably monitor the ice conditions.


      An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has a unique capability of high
      underwater spatial and temporal coverage, making it suitable for
      monitoring applications in complex under-ice operations. The sensor
      capabilities are present and will allow for both smart cameras, edge
      computing and data transmitting to satellite.
