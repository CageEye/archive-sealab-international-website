      The plans are advancing to harvest precious ores from the ocean floor and
      the technology is available. It’s the financial and regulatory uncertainty
      that has held the industry back.


      The world is striving for a better and more sustainable future. In the
      evolution of green energy production, fossil-free transportation and
      booming global communication, certain minerals are playing an increasingly
      important role. The needs for these minerals and metals are increasing,
      along with the need for a reduced footprint from extraction and
      production.


      SEALAB can help the industry to start mining by bringing visual
      information on how operators can avoid causing serious environmental harm.

      The deep sea — usually defined as the realm below 200 meters — is a world
      of extremes. Temperatures near the seabed in many places hover near 0 °C,
      there is next to no light, and pressures can exceed 1,000 bars, equivalent
      to having a couple of elephants standing on your big toe. But still, life
      thrives. The deep sea contains a vast array of ecosystems that researchers
      have barely begun to study.


      Without more information about these deep-sea environments, researchers
      don’t even know how to define the risks. “What is serious harm? There are
      some clear red lines. Machine vision and superb image quality from SEALAB
      will be necessary when humanity starts mining deep sea.
