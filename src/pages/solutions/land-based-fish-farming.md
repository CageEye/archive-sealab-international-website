    Globally land-based aquaculture facilities are increasingly being considered as a more sustainable alternative to open-water fish farms. Until just a few years ago, land-based fish farming was considered too costly, but this is changing as systems and technologies become increasingly sophisticated. Cutting edge technologies will be needed.
