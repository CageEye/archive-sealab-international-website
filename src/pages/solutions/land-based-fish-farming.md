  description: Globally land-based aquaculture facilities are increasingly being
    considered as a more sustainable alternative to open-water fish farms. Until
    just a few years ago, land-based fish farming was considered too costly, but
    this is changing as systems and technologies become increasingly
    sophisticated. Cutting edge technologies will be needed.
