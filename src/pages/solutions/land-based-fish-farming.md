    Globally land-based aquaculture facilities are increasingly being considered
    as a more sustainable alternative to open-water fish farms. Until just a few
    years ago, land-based fish farming was considered too costly, but this is
    changing as systems and technologies become increasingly sophisticated.
    Cutting edge technologies will be needed.

    Continuous monitoring is the best decision support available. With our
    unique camera technology and software, which communicate together (IoT), you
    get high-quality surveillance images right into your Control Room. A crystal
    clear look at what is going on in the cages can contribute to higher
    predictability, lower mortality and better fish welfare. The control room is
    using BlueThink™ Software Platform and is therefore open to third parties.
