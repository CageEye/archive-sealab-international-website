      Large systems, such as large manufacturing or power plants,
      telecommunication or computer networks, require distributed control,
      monitoring and diagnosis. A combination with AI and cameras, intelligent
      agents are software modules able to make decisions on their own,
      communicate with each other, learn new things and even “travel” from
      system to system.

      ## Smart Cameras and Edge Computing


      The surveillance system can be superimposed with smart cameras and edge
      computing over the existing SCADA control and monitoring network. This
      aims to increase performance, efficiency and stability in the existing
      monitoring system. Better detection of Corrosion, intruders, water
      reservoir and flow, dam movement monitoring, concrete monitoring, climate
      monitoring, lake filling and water distribution.
