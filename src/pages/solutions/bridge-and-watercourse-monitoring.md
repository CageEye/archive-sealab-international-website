      Earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of
      modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. Global
      climate change has already resulted in a wide range of impacts across
      every region of the world and many sectors of the economy that are
      expected to grow in the coming decades. 


      Bridge scour is the removal of sediments such as sand and gravel from
      around bridge abutments or piers. Scour, caused by swiftly moving water,
      can scoop out scour holes, compromising the integrity of a structure. 


      In several countries, bridge scour is one of the three main causes of
      bridge failure. Edge computing, sensors and smart cameras could report in
      real-time what’s going on.
