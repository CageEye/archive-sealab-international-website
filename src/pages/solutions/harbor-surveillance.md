      Smart cameras for monitoring both in harsh environment, both above surface
      and submerged, will work well in shallow or deep water, daytime or
      nighttime, all weather conditions. It can detect Divers, swimmers,
      submersibles - including mini-subs, small surface vessels, including
      rubber boats, kayaks, etc. and of course larges vessels.


      Realtime camera surveillance with machine vision from SEALAB will work
      very well in combination with ie Diver Detection Sonar (DDS), Surveillance
      radar and Electro-optical devices (CCD and FLIR).
