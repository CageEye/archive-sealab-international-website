      Both watercourses and the ocean space will need more monitoring than ever.
      New Ocean Monitoring Indicators provide key reference for climate change.
      World’s corals are under threat, and each year, about a quarter of the
      carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere ends up in the ocean, but
      how it happens is still not fully understood.

    Environmental monitoring is a key element in the sustainable exploitation of
    marine resources. The environment is under pressure from e.g. shipping and
    offshore oil and gas activities, and there is a large need for improved
    methods for monitoring and management. SEALAB aims to contribute to this by
    developing technology for continuous monitoring in time and space – by
    combining underwater cameras in 2D and 3D with Artificial Intelligence.
