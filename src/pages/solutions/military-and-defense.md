      With underwater machine vision from SEALAB you can compare camera images with photographic databases. In each case, human operators — not machines — make final judgments before anyone takes action.

      When an image is captured in an electronic form, it can be treated as a piece of data. Machine vision techniques use this data to simulate human vision by recognizing objects within the image and by interpreting aspects of the scene. The raw image is now commonly captured in a purely digital form using Charge Coupled Devices. But high-end cameras in 2D and 3D from SEALAB where images and video will be digitally captured through frame-grabbing techniques, will play the key role.

      Continued developments in algorithms promise to enable the economical use of machine vision in newer applications. The latest algorithms are expected to provide robust geometric pattern-matching with several degrees of freedom, compensate for extreme illumination and perform 3D analysis of complex shapes.

      Both color tracking and motion or range of images can be used. To have robotic vision, we need to combine those techniques to use the appropriate one at appropriate times. 
      
      SEALABs advanced FPGA technology for use under water address individual pixels rather than needing the whole frame. If there is something coming at you, you don't necessarily have to look at the whole thing, just that object. Addressing individual pixels also allows you to have much faster algorithms.
      
      ### There’s already a wide array
      
      There’s already a wide array of real-world use cases of machine vision in the military above surface. But to deliver AI solutions under water, we need smart cameras. There’s a wide breadth of current and near-term military applications where machine vision can be uses under water, i.e. surveillance, Autonomous Vehicles and Automation and Robotics. Smart 2D and 3D cameras from SEALAB in combination with AI flags vessels and people, as well as tracks objects of interest, for human analyst attention. The objects within the footage would have been labeled as what we know the objects to be, such as a vessel, a weapon, or a person. This labeled footage would then be run through the software’s machine learning algorithm. This would have trained the algorithm to discern the sequences and patterns of 1’s and 0’s that, to the human eye, form the video of a strategically relevant combat zone as displayed in drone surveillance footage. The algorithm behind the software would then be able to determine the contents of the footage and identify any anomalies or strategically relevant objects it has been trained to flag. The system then alerts a human operator in some unknown fashion and highlights the flagged objects within the video display. Next steps will be developing algorithms to determine risks in humans.

## Autonomous Vehicles

Autonomous vehicles are trained with numerous mounted cameras all around them at various heights and angles that allow it to detect how the car is moving from every perspective. The software is trained on thousands of hours of human driving footage showing the proper and safe way a vehicle should operate from various angles, in various lighting conditions, and in different weather conditions. The vessel or the underwater drone could then get a command to move to a new location. 

**Navies Needs Offensive Undersea Drones**, but the maritime domain has yet to see the kind of explosive innovation that UAVs have brought to land warfare. SEALABs superfast FPGA technology and smart 2D and 3D cameras will change everything in the ocean space.
