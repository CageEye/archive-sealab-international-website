    *For most of history, man has had to fight nature to survive; in this
    century he is beginning to realize that, in order to survive, he must
    protect it.*

## Social responsibility

Every year millions of tons of plastic and other human waste enter the oceans. This waste has a negative impact on a high number of marine species, threatening their survival. As a company that is also in part dependent on the ocean, SEALAB has a corporate social responsibility to help mitigate the danger of a polluted ocean space. To combat the alarming rate at which foreign elements enter the oceans SEALAB, inspired by the project *The Ocean Cleanup*, is contributing to keeping the oceans healthy by cleaning beaches and removing plastic waste wherever we find it.
