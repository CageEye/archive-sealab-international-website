## Social Responsibility

Every year millions of tons of plastic and other human waste enter the oceans. This waste has a negative impact on a high number of marine species, threatening their survival. As a company that is also in part dependent on the ocean, SEALAB has a corporate social responsibility to help mitigate the danger of a polluted ocean space. To combat the alarming rate at which foreign elements enter the oceans SEALAB, inspired by the project The Ocean Cleanup, is contributing to keeping the oceans healthy by cleaning beaches and removing plastic waste wherever we find it.
