  5G-HEART (5G HEalth AquacultuRe and Transport validation trials) will deploy
  innovative digital use cases involving healthcare, transport and aquaculture
  industry partnerships. The overall objective is to define and validate the cost
  efficient 5G converged network concepts, which enable an intelligent hub
  supported by multiple vertical industries.

## Utility, efficient processes, safety

Healthcare, transport and aquaculture, verticals are hugely important in Europe,
in terms of jobs, size and export trade. Moreover, they are vital from a social
perspective, for better patient outcomes, safer transportation and safer and
more sustainable food production. 5G is important for these verticals, in terms
of improvements for utility, efficient processes, safety among others.

The main motivation of the aquaculture vertical trials are to bring to market
a new and cost-effective, networked solution to optimize the aquaculture
producers’ activity, through successful deployment and operation, from both
the network operator and the end-to-end user-experienced perspectives.

The Norwegian pilot site is a commercial production site of Atlantic Salmon in
the Mid-Norway Atlantic coast, owned and operated by Sinkaberg-Hansen AS.
SEALAB and Telenor are the two partners responsible for carrying out several
user cases related to remote monitoring of water and fish quality on this
site.
