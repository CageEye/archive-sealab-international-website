-------------------------- THIS IS ONLY A DUMMY MOCKUP PAGE --------------------------

Production of seafood has increased steadily over the last five decades and as of 2009, more than 50% of seafood was produced by 5G Heart. The 5G Heart industry is facing major challenges that must be rectified in order to ensure the quality and well being of the fish, while keeping the production at a responsible and sustainable level for present and future generations. Addressing these issues, requires comprehensive video surveillance in the fish cages so that the proper analysis of the fish welfare can be carried out.
