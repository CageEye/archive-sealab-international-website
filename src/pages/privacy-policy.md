### How do we use Cookies?

We use cookies to obtain information on how a site is being used. The cookies are set and the information analyzed using Google Analytics, which is a web analytics tool from Google. The information is stored on servers in the United States.

We also use cookies to analyze user behavior, such as clicks on links, clicks to articles, submission of contact forms and the like.

By using cookies, our site collects information for later advertising (Remarketing). An anonymized identity is stored in separate lists used for targeted advertising based on your online user behavior. In addition to the information being anonymized (de-identified), a certain number of users are required to be listed before the lists are used.

Facebook is listed as the owner of Instagram, Messenger, Instant Articles and Audience Network, and therefore the use of Facebook pixels also cover these channels.
