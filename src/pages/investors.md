    Long-term client relationships are at the essence of SEALABs business; both
    commercial and pilot driven projects (IFU). E.g. 5G-HEART, an EU Horizon
    2020 backed project in cooperation with Telenor, Nokia and Intel, and the
    superb project for individual recognition of Salmon (Indisal) financed by
    The Research Council of Norway.

    SEALAB has greatly benefitted from the well-established cooperation with
    Universities and research institutions such as BI, NTNU and others. For
    instance, 15 Master Theses within Artificial Intelligence and Ocean Space
    technology are running under SEALAB’s wings where they commonly address
    issues to be solved within the Aquaculture industry and its economy as well
    as a more general Machine Vision approach towards the need of solutions in
    the Ocean Space
