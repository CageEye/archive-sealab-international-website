    Long-term client relationships are at the essence of SEALABs business; both commercial and pilot driven projects (IFU). E.g. 5G-HEART, an EU Horizon 2020 backed project in cooperation with Telenor, Nokia and Intel, and the superb project for individual recognition of Salmon (Indisal) financed by The Research Council of Norway.

    SEALAB has greatly benefitted from the well-established cooperation with Universities and research institutions such as BI, NTNU and others. For instance, 15 Master Theses within Artificial Intelligence and Ocean Space technology are running under SEALAB’s wings where they commonly address issues to be solved within the Aquaculture industry and its economy as well as a more general Machine Vision approach towards the need of solutions in the Ocean Space
