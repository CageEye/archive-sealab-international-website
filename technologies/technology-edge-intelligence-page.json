Machine vision and Artificial Intelligence (AI) require a data volume, data quality, and frequency that challenge earlier paradigms such as cloud computing. Instead of transporting all data to the cloud, important processing is done at the edge.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/technologies/edge-intelligence.md","sha":"d04f4b15820d85cb59d25994a318099c96d50edd"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2020-06-03T08:33:53.546Z","version":"1"}
