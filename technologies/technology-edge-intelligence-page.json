Machine vision and Artificial Intelligence (AI) require a data volume, data quality, and frequency that challenge earlier paradigms such as cloud computing. Instead of transporting all data to the cloud, important processing is done at the edge.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/technologies/edge-intelligence.md","sha":"d9bab38b53e5662819779adde10abe89d3778b46"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2020-06-03T08:33:53.546Z","version":"1"}
